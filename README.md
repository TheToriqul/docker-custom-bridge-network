## 📋 Overview

In this hands-on project, I dive deep into the world of Docker networking, exploring how to establish seamless communication between containers using custom bridge networks. By leveraging the power of user-defined networks, I demonstrate how to create isolated environments, enable name resolution, and enhance security in multi-container setups. Through practical examples and step-by-step guides, I showcase my ability to architect and manage complex Docker network topologies.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your local machine
- Basic understanding of Docker concepts and commands

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TheToriqul/docker-custom-bridge-network.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd docker-custom-bridge-network
   ```

3. Create the custom bridge network:
   ```
   docker network create --driver bridge my-bridge-network
   ```

4. Launch the Nginx containers:
   ```
   docker run -d --name container1 --network=my-bridge-network nginx
   docker run -d --name container2 --network=my-bridge-network nginx 
   docker run -d --name container3 --network=my-bridge-network nginx
   ```

5. Verify container communication by following the steps outlined in the [Communication Verification Guide](docs/communication-verification.md).
